# üìù Text Analytics with Python

This repository contains a comprehensive text analytics workflow using Python. The project demonstrates key Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques including text preprocessing, vectorization, sentiment classification, and model evaluation.

## üìå Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze and classify text data using popular NLP libraries. It covers the full pipeline from raw text to model predictions, with a focus on building interpretable and efficient machine learning models for text classification tasks.

## üöÄ Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Tokenization and stopword removal  
- TF-IDF and Count Vectorizer implementation  
- Sentiment encoding  
- Train-test split  
- Model training with Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Transformers  
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score  
- Transformer-based model using Hugging Face's `transformers` library (e.g., BERT)
